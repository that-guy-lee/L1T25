# "Swimming"

This was a website that I made when I was still in the very beginning of my coding website. 
It's not very impressive by my standards today, but when I wrote it, I was very proud.
Basically, this is just a website that tells the end user about swimming
It also tells user what times the "Aqua Warriors" club swims at

## Installation

Installation is simple. Just clone or download the repo, and open index.html

## Usage

Again, very simple.
Navigate using the bar on the top.
